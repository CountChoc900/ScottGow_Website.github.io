# Welcome to my Website Repository #
This repository contains all the files, projects, and html pages that are part of my personal website. 
This website was downloaded as a template, so much of the content is CSS and html styling which I have edited to fit my preferences, and the goal of this website was to make a living resume people can view to stay up-to-date on my projects and achievements. This website was a lot of fun to make, and I look forward to further refining this page as new interests and projects are worth adding.

## Content ##
There are several files in the projects folder you are free to browse. 
The projects include: 
- [python coding](/projects/KNES381_Python_Project.ipynb)
- [excel dashboards](/projects/athlete-performance-dataset-II.xlsx)
- scratch games
- [Honours poster](/scott_images/Honours_Poster.png)
- Honours Thesis
- [photo editing](/scott_images/Skiing_everest.png)
- [sport technique analysis](/projects/2025-03-27_11-29-42(1).mp4)
- [Prism data analysis](Significant_Results.png)

## Image Content ##
The [images folder](/images) was created by the developer of this template to reference photos for styling. I use some of the same images for banners, but I created a new folder to store all images I wish to use called [scott_images](/scott_images). 

## Other Pages ##
The [index.html](/index.html) is the home page. The other pages are additional html pages with their own styling. I only use one for a photo collage titled [Interests.html](/Interests.html) and have the others unlinked from my homepage, but it's easy to re-add!

## CSS Assets ##
The assets folder contains content related to the bulk of the syling of the website. The [main.css](/assets/css/main.css) is where all major formatting changes can be made and it's easy to modify when using your browsers built-in website inspector.
