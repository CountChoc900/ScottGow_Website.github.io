# Welcome to my Website Repository #
This repository contains all the files, projects, and html pages that are part of my personal website. 
This website was downloaded as a template, so much of the content is CSS styling and html webpages which I have edited to fit my styling preferences, and the goal of this website was to make a living resume people can view to stay up-to-date on my projects and achievements. This website was a lot of fun to make, and I look forward to further refining this page in the future.

## Content ##
There are several files in the projects folder you are free to browse. 
The projects include: 
- python coding
- excel dashboards
- scratch games
- Honours project
- Honours Thesis
- photo editing
- sport technique analysis

## Image Content ##
The images folder was created by the developer of this template to reference photos for styling. I use some of the same images for banners, but I created a new folder to store all images I wish to use called scott_images. 

## Other Pages ##
the index.html is the home page. The other pages are additional html pages with their own styling. I only use one for a photo collage and have the others unlinked from my homepage, but it's easy to re-add!
