# Welcome to my Website Repository #
This repository contains all the files, projects, and html pages that are part of my personal website. 
This website was downloaded as a template, so much of the content is CSS and html styling which I have edited to fit my preferences, and the goal of this website was to make a living resume people can view to stay up-to-date on my projects and achievements. This website was a lot of fun to make, and I look forward to further refining this page as new interests and projects are worth adding.

## Content ##
There are several files in the projects folder you are free to browse. 
The projects include: 
- python coding
- excel dashboards
- scratch games
- Honours project
- Honours Thesis
- photo editing
- sport technique analysis
- Prism data analysis

## Image Content ##
The images folder was created by the developer of this template to reference photos for styling. I use some of the same images for banners, but I created a new folder to store all images I wish to use called scott_images. 

## Other Pages ##
the index.html is the home page. The other pages are additional html pages with their own styling. I only use one for a photo collage (Interests.html) and have the others unlinked from my homepage, but it's easy to re-add!

## CSS Assets ##
The assets folder contains content related to the bulk of the syling of the website. The main.css is where all major formatting changes can be made and it's easy to modify when using your browsers built-in website inspector.
