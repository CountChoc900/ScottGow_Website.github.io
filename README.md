# Welcome to my Repository #
This repository contains all the files, projects, and html pages that are part of my personal website. 
This website was downloaded as a template, so much of the content is CSS styling and html webpages which I have edited to fit my styling preferences, and the goal of this website was to make a living resume people can view to stay up-to-date on my projects and achievements. This website was a lot of fun to make, and I look forward to further refining this page in the future.
